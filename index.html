        <h2><strong>Short Bio:</strong></h2>
        <p class="info">I received my BS and MS degrees in Electrical Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, 
            in 1996 and 1999, respectively. From 1999 to 2001, I was working with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. as 
            an R&D engineer on GPRS and WCDMA projects. From 2002 to 2005, I was working at UTStarcom Reseach Center, 
            Shenzhen, China, as a senior engineer and team leader on WCDMA project. Since 2005, I am working toward the 
            PhD degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Florida. I am expecting 
            to graduate in 2011. I am now a graduate student member of IEEE.</p>
        <h2><strong>Research Interests:</strong></h2>
        <p class="info">My previous researches focus on wireless MAC (including IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16), routing algorithms, 
            and cross-layer design in wireless networks with emphasis on wireless ad hoc networks, wireless mesh networks, and WLAN. 
            I have been also investigating mobility management/resource management issues in wireless mesh networks, cellular networks. 
            I am currently interested in multi-hop cellular networks and I have proposed a few ideas on mobility management and resource 
            management for this new type of cellular networks.</p>
